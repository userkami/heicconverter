# What is HEIC and Why Convert It?

HEIC (High Efficiency Image Format) is Apple's default image format for photos taken on iPhones and iPads. While it offers better compression and quality than JPG, it's not widely supported on other platforms like Windows, Android, or many websites.

## Why Can't I Open HEIC Files?

Most non-Apple devices and software don't natively support HEIC files. When you try to open an HEIC image on Windows or share it online, you might encounter:
- Error messages
- Blank previews
- Compatibility issues
